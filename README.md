# Spendings
My first Java project started with a need for a personalised program that could keep track of my weekly expenses.
Unfortunately the latest .java file is missing, so for the code review I have uploaded almost finished, beta version of the program.
You can also check the screenshots to see functionality of this software.

Requires Java installed on the computer.
Start program by running Spendings.jar file.
